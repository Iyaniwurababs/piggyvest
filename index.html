        <h1>JULIUS CAESAR</h1>
        <p>Julius Caesar (born July 12/13, 100? BCE, Rome [Italy]—died March 15, 44 BCE, Rome) was a celebrated Roman general and statesman, the conqueror of Gaul (58–50 BCE), victor in the civil war of 49–45 BCE, and dictator (46–44 BCE), who was launching a series of political and social reforms when he was assassinated by a group of nobles in the Senate House on the Ides of March. He is one of the major figures of Classical antiquity.

            Caesar changed the course of the history of the Greco-Roman world decisively and irreversibly. The Greco-Roman society has been extinct for so long that most of the names of its great men mean little to the average, educated modern person. But Caesar’s name, like Alexander’s, is still on people’s lips throughout the Christian and Islamic worlds. Even people who know nothing of Caesar as a historic personality are familiar with his family name as a title signifying a ruler who is in some sense uniquely supreme or paramount—the meaning of Kaiser in German, tsar in the Slavonic languages, and qayṣar in the languages of the Islamic world.

            Who invented the Caesar salad?
            Caesar salad has nothing to do with the Roman emperor. It was actually invented in 1924 by Caesar Cardini, an Italian restaurant owner in Tijuana, Mexico.

            Caesar’s gens (clan) name, Julius (Iulius), is also familiar in the Christian world, for in Caesar’s lifetime the Roman month Quintilis, in which he was born, was renamed “July” in his honour. This name has survived, as has Caesar’s reform of the calendar. The old Roman calendar was inaccurate and manipulated for political purposes. Caesar’s calendar, the Julian calendar, is still partially in force in the Eastern Orthodox Christian countries, and the Gregorian calendar, now in use in the West, is the Julian, slightly corrected by Pope Gregory XIII.</p>
            <h1>FAMILY BACKGROUND AND CAREER OF JULIUS CAESAR</h1>
            <p>Caesar’s gens, the Julii, were patricians—i.e., members of Rome’s original aristocracy, which had coalesced in the 4th century BCE with a number of leading plebeian (commoner) families to form the nobility that had been the governing class in Rome since then. By Caesar’s time, the number of surviving patrician gentes was small; and in the gens Julia the Caesares seem to have been the only surviving family. Though some of the most powerful noble families were patrician, patrician blood was no longer a political advantage; it was actually a handicap, since a patrician was debarred from holding the paraconstitutional but powerful office of tribune of the plebs. The Julii Caesares traced their lineage back to the goddess Venus, but the family was not snobbish or conservative-minded. It was also not rich or influential or even distinguished.</p>
            <p>A Roman noble won distinction for himself and his family by securing election to a series of public offices, which culminated in the consulship, with the censorship possibly to follow. This was a difficult task for even the ablest and most gifted noble unless he was backed by substantial family wealth and influence. Rome’s victory over Carthage in the Second Punic War (218–201 BCE) had made Rome the paramount power in the Mediterranean basin; an influential Roman noble family’s clients (that is, protégés who, in return, gave their patrons their political support) might include kings and even whole nations, besides numerous private individuals. The requirements and the costs of a Roman political career in Caesar’s day were high, and the competition was severe; but the potential profits were of enormous magnitude. One of the perquisites of the praetorship and the consulship was the government of a province, which gave ample opportunity for plunder. The whole Mediterranean world was, in fact, at the mercy of the Roman nobility and of a new class of Roman businessmen, the equites (“knights”), which had grown rich on military contracts and on tax farming.</p>

        <h1>Ancient Egypt- The Pharaoh</h1>
        <p> Pharaoh
The ruler of ancient Egypt was called pharaoh  . Pharaohs were looked upon as more than rulers. They were gods chosen to lead the people and maintain order, and provided an important link between the Egyptian people and their gods. This word comes from "per-ao"  or "great house." The title shows respect for the king by referring to him as the palace where government decisions were made. Egypt was usually ruled by a man, although a few women did rule in their own right.

This carving of Seti I shows the great ruler who restored order to the kingdom and returned Egyptian art and architecture to the powerful style of past dynasties. Seti is depicted as strong and forceful, wearing the ruler’s nemes headdress and false beard. The beard connects Seti I to Osiris, the god of the underworld who reigns for all time. Since Egyptian rulers belonged to the realm of the gods, they were represented as eternally strong and youthful. Seti’s muscular shoulders and strong gaze suggests that he not only maintained order, but also provided strong leadership for the people.

We know this is Seti because his name appears on the back of the sculpture in a cartouche. A cartouche is an oblong frame designed to enclose the name of a ruler.

        <h1>The Tomb of Pharaoh</h1>
        <p>The tombs of the Egyptian Pharaoh are known as The pyramids of Giza and Nile delta. During Egypt's, the New Kingdom, the Pyramids became a royal burial ground for Pharaohs. These pyramids were well stocked with all the material goods a ruler might need in the next world like a mirror, golden mask etc.</p>
        <h1>The Pyramid</h1>
        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built c. 2600 BC,[3] over a period of about 27 years,[4] the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis".[5] It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.</p>
